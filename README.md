# Laundry Order Management App

A Flutter mobile application for managing laundry service orders. The app supports creating and tracking orders, advancing order status through a defined workflow, searching and filtering, and viewing a live revenue dashboard.

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Version |
|---|---|
| Flutter SDK | ≥ 3.19.0 |
| Dart | ≥ 3.3.0 |
| Android Studio / Xcode | Latest stable |
| Device / Emulator | Android API 21+ or iOS 13+ |

---

## How to Run

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/venetiafaber/laundry-order-management.git
cd laundry-order-management

# 2. Install dependencies
flutter pub get

# 3. Run the app
flutter run
```

> ⚠️ **Schema changes:** If the database schema is modified (e.g. a column is added), delete the app from your device or emulator before running again. SQLite does not auto-migrate — the old database file will persist on-device and cause errors if the schema has changed.

```

### Architecture

The app is organised into three layers:

- **Data layer** (`db/`) — handles all raw SQLite read/write operations
- **Logic layer** (`providers/`) — applies business rules, holds app state, and notifies the UI of changes
- **UI layer** (`screens/`) — reads from the Provider and dispatches user actions
